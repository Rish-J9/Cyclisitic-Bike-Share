# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

Welcome to the Cyclistic Bike Share project! This repository is dedicated to analyzing Cyclistic's bike-share data to uncover insights about ridership trends, user types, and business opportunities. The project will involve data analysis using SQL and visualization using Power BI.

## Project Overview

- **Phase 1:** Data analysis using SQL scripts to clean, transform, and extract insights from the raw bike-share data.
- **Phase 2:** Data visualization using Power BI to communicate findings and business recommendations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) (for visualization, to be added later)

### Repository Structure

```
Cyclisitic-Bike-Share/
│
├── scripts/           # SQL scripts for data analysis (to be uploaded)
├── visualizations/    # Power BI files (to be uploaded later)
└── README.md
```

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rish-J9/Cyclisitic-Bike-Share.git
   ```
2. **SQL Analysis:**
   - Navigate to the `scripts/` directory (to be uploaded).
   - Execute SQL scripts on your local database with the Cyclistic data loaded.
   - Review and modify scripts as needed for your SQL environment.

3. **Power BI Visualization:**
   - Once available, open `.pbix` files from the `visualizations/` directory in Power BI Desktop.
   - Explore the dashboards and reports.

## Project Phases

- **Phase 1:** Upload and use SQL scripts for data analysis.
- **Phase 2:** Upload and use Power BI files for visualization (coming soon).
